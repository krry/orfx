# BLOPA — Binary List of Permissible Acronyms

Rule:
- **No acronyms** unless they have been explicitly **defined and expanded** in the same document/thread.
- After expansion, we can decide whether the acronym is allowed to “collapse” again.
- When in doubt: spell it out.

## Allowlist (permissible after first expansion)

- *(none yet)*

## Forbidlist (do not use)

- **CI** — Continuous Integration (spell out: "Continuous Integration")
