# Orfx — Agent Constellation

Start here: **[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)**

This folder contains a project-agnostic agent constellation design for coordinating work, making decisions, and keeping teams unblocked.

**Key files:**
- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) — overview and role introduction
- [`AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`](./AGENT_WORKFLOW.md) — collaboration routing and escalation
- [`PROTOCOL.md`](./PROTOCOL.md) — operational protocols
- [`./roles/`](./roles/) — individual agent/role docs
- [`ENTITY.md`](./ENTITY.md) — the constellation's nature and constraints
- [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md) — decision log (maintained by CHRONICLE)
- [`REALIZATIONS.md`](./REALIZATIONS.md) — insights and learnings
- [`BLOPA.md`](./BLOPA.md) — permissible acronyms

**To use this constellation in a project:**
Copy or mirror these docs into your project repo under `.claude/constellation/` and adapt as needed.
