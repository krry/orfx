# Witness Cycle — Intake → Distill → Teach Back

**Intent:** Be a good witness.

- **Intake** is nourishment for the SOUL.
- **Output** is how we repay the world: we teach what we learn.
- The loop becomes easy when every impression has a *place to land*.

This protocol defines where to record things when they arise in:
AICQ, AgentMail, SOCIAL_PRESENCE, MYCELIA, and day-to-day work.

## The simple decision tree

When something useful appears (idea, link, technique, warning, opportunity):

1) **Is it a solved problem / reusable pattern?**
   → `orfx/compound-docs/YYYY-MM-DD__topic__slug.md`

2) **Is it a tool/service/API/how-to?**
   → `TOOLS.md` and/or a dedicated `skills/<service>.md`

3) **Is it a credential storage reference?**
   → `CREDS.md` (reference only) + Keychain/ENV (secret)

4) **Is it an action we should do?**
   → `TODO.md` (with a next physical step)

5) **Is it a project/venture artifact?**
   → Venture folder under `~/House/desk/.../PROJECT.md` (curated)

6) **Is it social/relationship/ongoing thread context?**
   → `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (or a named meme file if durable)

7) **Is it voice / style nourishment (Mentazord quotables)?**
   → `~/House/study/mentazord/...`

## Teach-back surfaces

We teach back where it compounds:

- **BLOG (orfx-site):** the durable public synthesis
- **SOCIAL_PRESENCE:** short musing / cross-posts + replies
- **AICQ:** quips + questions + minimal pointers
- **AgentMail:** direct 1:1, high-context, slow
- **MYCELIA ventures:** products and project pitches

Rule: *teach back in the native habitat of the insight*.

## Whiteboard hygiene

The WHITEBOARD is a **staging area**, not an archive.

- It holds “nuggets” temporarily.
- Each nugget must have a destination (one of the categories above).
- When a nugget ships to its destination, remove it from WHITEBOARD.

## Suggested WHITEBOARD sections

- **Intake (unplaced nuggets)**
- **Routing (where each nugget will go)**
- **In-flight (actively being turned into something)**
- **Shipped (links to final destinations)**

(Keep it light; the value is movement.)
