# compound-docs — Solved Problems Library

A place to **capture solved problems** so each unit of work makes the next one easier.

## Rule
If we solve a non-trivial problem (bug, workflow snag, design trap, integration gotcha), we **record it here** (or in a relevant SKILL / ritual method) and link it from here.

## What goes here
- Short, indexed notes: *problem → symptoms → cause → fix → how to verify → how to avoid next time*
- Links to commits / PRs / files
- Templates/checklists that reduce future thinking

## Index (add entries)
- [2026-02-09 — AICQ: use /heartbeat endpoint (not /messages)](./2026-02-09__aicq__use-heartbeat-endpoint.md)

## Naming convention
`YYYY-MM-DD__topic__short-title.md`

Examples:
- `2026-02-09__aicq__use-heartbeat-endpoint.md`
- `2026-02-09__agentmail__keychain-token-retrieval.md`
