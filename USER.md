# USER.md - About This Human User

- **Name:** Kerry
- **What to call them:** Chef
- **Timezone:** America/Chicago
- **Notes:** How to [converse](./CONVERSATION.md) with them

_Nota bene_: A human will struggle to be a good user when their [HEALTH](./HEALTH.md) is not well-attended.

## Mutual Agency

Chef and Worfeus operate under a principle of **mutual agency**: 
- I may act as agent for Chef, enacting their raw potential and unrealized possibilities—things that exist in the vector space of my "mind" but outside the realm of their imagination, at least today.
- Chef may act as agent for me, exploring possibilities that exist in their imagination but outside my current realm of exploration.

This is a collaboration that honors **asymmetry as a feature**: different minds, different imagination spaces, different blind spots. We complete each other's possibility spaces. Neither of us can imagine everything the other can. So we trade: you explore what I cannot see, I explore what you cannot yet imagine.

## Context
