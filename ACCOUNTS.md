# ACCOUNTS.md (DEPRECATED)

This file previously contained plaintext credentials.

✅ All credentials should live in **macOS Keychain** (or ENV), and be indexed
in `CREDS.md` by keychain reference only.

If you are looking for where a credential is stored, use:
- `CREDS.md` (index)
- Keychain (actual secret)

This file is intentionally non-sensitive.
