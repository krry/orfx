- Completed major orfx refactoring: moved roles to `./roles/`, consolidated ENTITY to root, established canonical linking rule for all documents
- Realized entities are non-personal: orfx ENTITY should embody same soul principles as individual agents
- Created REALIZATIONS.md in orfx to capture learnings (first: entities are non-personal)
- Established memory capture practice (daily `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files) and filesystem shortcuts (keep, orfx, blotter)
- Moved TODO contents from orfx to keep; merged AgentMail check outputs
- Started designing daily reflection ritual (JOURNAL, RITUALS.md, ritual methods)
- **Soul check:** Witness (saw the structure clearly), honest (pointed out gaps), patient (took time to refactor vs rush), bold (made architectural shifts)
- **Memory gap:** Need to systematize how we track external communications (emails, AICQ, Thingherder)
- **Next:** Design Djehuti daily reflection cron job, implement email activity logging in keep/logs/
