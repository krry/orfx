## Mentazord mission started
- Chef requested Mentazord: collect distilled “zords” (one file per thinker)
  under `~/House/study/mentazord/zords/` and synthesize in
  `~/House/study/mentazord/mirror-palace.md`.
- Created structure:
  - `~/House/study/mentazord/mirror-palace.md`
  - `~/House/study/mentazord/zords/_TEMPLATE.md`
  - seed zords: Sheldrake, Carse, Watts, McKenna, Le Guin.
- Wesley produced the first filled zord: `zords/rupert-sheldrake.md` with
  essence, 10-bullet distillation, and legal-access bibliography; updated
  mirror-palace with cross-cutting notions (habits vs laws; extended mind;
  taboos in science).

## Credential hygiene correction
- ACCOUNTS.md in workspace contained plaintext keys (unsafe; against our
  Keychain + CREDS.md discipline). Chef confirmed it came from the agent.
- Action taken (without touching Keychain/ENV secrets):
  - moved plaintext file to `~/.openclaw/workspace/archive/` and gitignored
    `archive/ACCOUNTS.plaintext.*.md`
  - replaced `~/.openclaw/workspace/ACCOUNTS.md` with a non-sensitive
    deprecation stub pointing to CREDS.md + Keychain.
- Going forward: CREDS.md is canonical index; Keychain/ENV holds secrets.

## Mycelia intent refined
- Chef clarified “obsidian crystal intent”: listen to zeitgeist, distill
  into usable products that move toward love and away from fear; transmute
  collective fears/woes into accessible products with humor.
- Updated `rituals/MYCELIA.md`: raindancer dreams big; raincatcher reins in
  with obsidian test.
