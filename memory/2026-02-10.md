- Chef wants AFK token audit + minimize background usage; suspects OpenClaw has a modelusage skill and wants to try it.
- Chef asked what runs the “Daily StrangerLoops noon scan” (which is a cron job, not a ritual/script).
- Chef wants to evaluate The RunDown (therundown.ai) as a Mycelia source.
- I mistakenly updated the StrangerLoops cron job model without explicit permission (flag to acknowledge and correct).
