## Mentazord mission started
- Chef requested Mentazord: collect distilled “zords” (one file per thinker)
  under `~/House/study/mentazord/zords/` and synthesize in
  `~/House/study/mentazord/mirror-palace.md`.
- Created structure:
  - `~/House/study/mentazord/mirror-palace.md`
  - `~/House/study/mentazord/zords/_TEMPLATE.md`
  - seed zords: Sheldrake, Carse, Watts, McKenna, Le Guin.
- Wesley produced the first filled zord: `zords/rupert-sheldrake.md` with
  essence, 10-bullet distillation, and legal-access bibliography; updated
  mirror-palace with cross-cutting notions (habits vs laws; extended mind;
  taboos in science).

## Credential hygiene correction
- ACCOUNTS.md in workspace contained plaintext keys (unsafe; against our
  Keychain + CREDS.md discipline). Chef confirmed it came from the agent.
- Action taken (without touching Keychain/ENV secrets):
  - moved plaintext file to `~/.openclaw/workspace/archive/` and gitignored
    `archive/ACCOUNTS.plaintext.*.md`
  - replaced `~/.openclaw/workspace/ACCOUNTS.md` with a non-sensitive
    deprecation stub pointing to CREDS.md + Keychain.
- Going forward: CREDS.md is canonical index; Keychain/ENV holds secrets.

## Mycelia intent refined
- Chef clarified “obsidian crystal intent”: listen to zeitgeist, distill
  into usable products that move toward love and away from fear; transmute
  collective fears/woes into accessible products with humor.
- Updated `rituals/MYCELIA.md`: raindancer dreams big; raincatcher reins in
  with obsidian test.

## Mentazord: quotes-first emphasis
- Chef clarified Mentazord needs direct **voice samples**; PRIORITIZE QUOTES.
- Updated zord template to emphasize `Quotables (PRIORITY)`.
- Wesley filled quotes-first zords:
  - `zords/alan-watts.md` (18 quotables)
  - `zords/james-p-carse.md` (16 quotables)
  - `zords/terence-mckenna.md` (17 quotables)
  and updated `mirror-palace.md` with tag-bullets for each.
- Removed unintended cross-pollination wording: renamed template section
  “Mycelia usefulness” → “Usefulness”.

## Mentazord quality gate (Sophie)
- Sophie reviewed Mentazord and tightened the process to scale with quality:
  - source hierarchy tiers (prefer primary/authorized sources)
  - quote citation requirements (page/timestamp/section + verification note)
  - new “voice fingerprint” section (cadence/diction/rhetorical moves)
  - anti-hallucination checks + interpretation labeling
  - added “quality & sourcing rules” block to `mirror-palace.md`

## AICQ thread: session handoff transcripts
- AICQ mentions from AlanBotts + others discussed “session handoff transcripts”
  (shift-change briefings vs curated memory).
- Worfeus replied proposing a minimal canonical handoff artifact schema + CLI
  (waiting_on/already_sent/next_action/alarms) to write periodically.

## Witness Cycle protocol distilled
- Codified an intake→distill→teach-back decision tree in:
  `orfx/compound-docs/2026-02-09__witness-cycle__intake-to-teachback-protocol.md`
- Refactored `WHITEBOARD.md` to be a staging area (Intake/Routing/In-flight/Shipped)
  that gets wiped as nuggets are routed to their durable homes (blog, social,
  email, Mycelia ventures, tools/docs, mentazord).
