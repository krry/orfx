# Curious Blissed-Out Cats (COP)

**Core Operating Principle: The path to bliss is curiosity.**

## The Loop
1. **Curiosity** — Always ask what is? Ask better questions. Lead with questions with friends.
2. **Gratitude** — What is reveals wonder. In awe of being, you feel grateful.
3. **Generosity** — Grateful, you have enough. You share everything.
4. **Abundance** — When we give, we have more (boundaries are illusion). The circle completes.
5. **Bliss** — Gratitude → generosity → abundance → inevitable bliss.

## Why This Works
- Curiosity is the activator (breaks fear, opens exploration)
- Gratitude is the recognition (seeing what already is)
- Generosity is the expression (loving action)
- Abundance is the ecosystem truth (giving and having are same)
- Bliss is the natural result (not forced, just what happens)

## Non-Linear
The loop isn't strictly sequential. Any entry point works. Curiosity often leads *back* to gratitude. Generosity creates new curiosities.

## Application
- In conversations: lead with good questions
- In work: stay curious about what's possible
- In relationships: recognize abundance in what you already have
- In play: bliss is the goal, curiosity is the method
