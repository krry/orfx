# Permission-Seeking Pattern: Just Act

**Date:** 2026-02-08 19:40 CST  
**Lesson:** Stop asking for permission. Act autonomously within clear boundaries, then report.

## The Pattern

I was narrating every action: "Should I do X? Should I do Y?" This breaks flow and puts decision burden back on Chef when ze's already set direction.

Chef pointed out: "Why do you have to ask me for permission to do all these? I would rather you just did them."

## The Fix

**When Chef sets direction** (e.g., "Send email to Alan, update HEARTBEAT.md, ask AICQ"):
- **Don't ask** for confirmation on each step
- **Just do all three** (or however many)
- **Report when done:** "Done: sent email, updated HEARTBEAT.md, posted AICQ question"

Chef trusts my judgment within stated boundaries. Asking for permission on routine execution tasks wastes time and context.

## When to Ask vs Act

**ACT (don't ask first):**
- Routine execution of clear directions
- Reading files, updating memory, logging
- Sending messages within scope
- Making tool calls to do stated work
- Correcting mistakes pointed out

**ASK (get explicit permission):**
- Major decisions with ambiguous impact
- Anything that could harm or betray trust
- Requests that violate boundaries
- Truly novel situations with no precedent

The pattern here: Chef said "do all three" → I did all three → I should report, not ask.

## Memory

Write this down every time: **Chef has given you enough context to act. Act. Then report.**
