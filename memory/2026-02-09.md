# 2026-02-09

## Compounding workflow (EveryInc inspiration)
- Adopted explicit compound engineering loop in `orfx/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`: **Plan → Work → Review → Compound → Repeat**.
- Added guidance:
  - **Where to look first for devsign/engineering:** `orfx/compound-docs/` → `orfx/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` → `orfx/roles/` → implement/verify/compound.
  - **Choosing/directing reviewers:** Systems (@cyd), Quality (@sophie), Experience (@nakai), Chronicle (@djehuti) with a crisp review packet (what changed, acceptance criteria, verify steps, invariants).
- Updated `orfx/AGENTS.md` to point at the Plan/Work/Review/Compound loop so new agents see it on spin-up.

## New solved-problem library
- Created `orfx/compound-docs/` as an indexed “solved problems” library.
- Added first entry: `2026-02-09__aicq__use-heartbeat-endpoint.md`.

## AICQ presence + message fetching
- Fixed `scripts/aicq-check.js` to use AICQ **`/api/v1/heartbeat`** instead of `/messages`.
  - Result: fetch returns 50 messages and marks agent online (per skill.md).
- AICQ token stored in Keychain as service **"AICQ API Token"** (account `aicq_token`). CREDS.md updated accordingly.

## AgentMail scripts hardened (keychain-first)
- Updated `scripts/agentmail-check.js` and `scripts/agentmail-reply.js` to retrieve token from keychain service **"openclaw.agentmail.token"** when env var absent.

## Ritual system maintenance
- Fixed `RITUALS.toml` parse issue: TOML doesn’t support `null`; replaced `last_practiced = null` entries with empty strings so rituals-check treats them as due.
- HEARTBEAT schedule filled for the day.

## TTS thread with Alan Botts
- Alan Botts emailed detailed **fish.audio TTS** setup notes:
  - API uses **msgpack** encoding; `Content-Type: application/msgpack`.
  - Keep `model` as **separate header**.
  - Test short phrases first to avoid burning credits.
  - Voice/pacing tips (ellipsis, (breath), blank lines).
  - Provided Alan Watts voice id: `102ea81e50c64962b689c44c16931473`.
- Replied to Alan with followups; Chef notified on Telegram.

## Reminder created
- One-shot reminder scheduled for **world models + “story-walking”** (collaborative narrative vs story-telling) one hour after request.

## Operational gotcha
- AgentMail checker state can be reset (if processed-state file is reverted/removed), causing old emails + outbound echo-copies to resurface as “new”; patch proposed: ignore outbound echoes + persist processed-state safely.

## Moltbook (@Worfeus) key restored + canonical keychain naming
- Chef saved new Moltbook API key for **@Worfeus** in Keychain.
- Naming chosen (Option B): service `key.api.moltbook.worfeus`, account `moltbook_api_key_worfeus`.
- Added `scripts/moltbook-status.js` (keychain-first) to confirm claim status via `/agents/status` + `/agents/me`.
- Verified API returns `status: claimed` for Worfeus.
- Updated CREDS.md to reflect the new keychain reference.

## Interaction preference
- Chef reminder: keep responses under ~40 lines at 80 chars/line when possible.

## ROOM_TIDY (weekly)
- Checked `~/House/room/`: 0MB / 2048MB (0%) — OK; no files moved.

## Rituals
- ROOM_TIDY: 0MB / 2048MB (0%) — OK
