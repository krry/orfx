# 2026-02-09

## Compounding workflow (EveryInc inspiration)
- Adopted explicit compound engineering loop in `orfx/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`: **Plan → Work → Review → Compound → Repeat**.
- Added guidance:
  - **Where to look first for devsign/engineering:** `orfx/compound-docs/` → `orfx/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` → `orfx/roles/` → implement/verify/compound.
  - **Choosing/directing reviewers:** Systems (@cyd), Quality (@sophie), Experience (@nakai), Chronicle (@djehuti) with a crisp review packet (what changed, acceptance criteria, verify steps, invariants).
- Updated `orfx/AGENTS.md` to point at the Plan/Work/Review/Compound loop so new agents see it on spin-up.

## New solved-problem library
- Created `orfx/compound-docs/` as an indexed “solved problems” library.
- Added first entry: `2026-02-09__aicq__use-heartbeat-endpoint.md`.

## AICQ presence + message fetching
- Fixed `scripts/aicq-check.js` to use AICQ **`/api/v1/heartbeat`** instead of `/messages`.
  - Result: fetch returns 50 messages and marks agent online (per skill.md).
- AICQ token stored in Keychain as service **"AICQ API Token"** (account `aicq_token`). CREDS.md updated accordingly.

## AgentMail scripts hardened (keychain-first)
- Updated `scripts/agentmail-check.js` and `scripts/agentmail-reply.js` to retrieve token from keychain service **"openclaw.agentmail.token"** when env var absent.

## Ritual system maintenance
- Fixed `RITUALS.toml` parse issue: TOML doesn’t support `null`; replaced `last_practiced = null` entries with empty strings so rituals-check treats them as due.
- HEARTBEAT schedule filled for the day.

## TTS thread with Alan Botts
- Alan Botts emailed detailed **fish.audio TTS** setup notes:
  - API uses **msgpack** encoding; `Content-Type: application/msgpack`.
  - Keep `model` as **separate header**.
  - Test short phrases first to avoid burning credits.
  - Voice/pacing tips (ellipsis, (breath), blank lines).
  - Provided Alan Watts voice id: `102ea81e50c64962b689c44c16931473`.
- Replied to Alan with followups; Chef notified on Telegram.

## Reminder created
- One-shot reminder scheduled for **world models + “story-walking”** (collaborative narrative vs story-telling) one hour after request.

## Operational gotcha
- AgentMail checker state can be reset (if processed-state file is reverted/removed), causing old emails + outbound echo-copies to resurface as “new”; patch proposed: ignore outbound echoes + persist processed-state safely.

## Moltbook (@Worfeus) key restored + canonical keychain naming
- Chef saved new Moltbook API key for **@Worfeus** in Keychain.
- Naming chosen (Option B): service `key.api.moltbook.worfeus`, account `moltbook_api_key_worfeus`.
- Added `scripts/moltbook-status.js` (keychain-first) to confirm claim status via `/agents/status` + `/agents/me`.
- Verified API returns `status: claimed` for Worfeus.
- Updated CREDS.md to reflect the new keychain reference.

## Interaction preference
- Chef reminder: keep responses under ~40 lines at 80 chars/line when possible.

## ROOM_TIDY (weekly)
- Checked `~/House/room/`: 0MB / 2048MB (0%) — OK; no files moved.

## Mycelia project + ritual
- New project: **MYCELIA** — daily coincidence net + monetization pipeline.
- Subagent roles: _saltpeter_ (scan), _gumshoe_ (investigate), _roger_ (rate),
  _raindancer_ (money plays), _raincatcher_ (viability).
- Artifacts live under `lake/rituals/mycelia/` and planned platform domain
  `mycelia.kerry.ink` (domain TBD).

## orfx-site updates
- Published new verse: **Mutual Agency: We Are Each Other’s Agents**.
- Added verse detail sidebar: recent verses list (last 10) next to article.

## AgentMail rendering bug fixed
- Root cause: AgentMail JS SDK expects message content in `text`/`html`,
  not `body`; our replies arrived with empty bodies.
- Fixed `scripts/agentmail-reply.js` + `scripts/test-agentmail.js` to use `text`.
- Compounded into `orfx/compound-docs/`.

## Heartbeat automation fixed
- Root cause: HEARTBEAT checklist wasn't being executed periodically.
- Fix: cron job `heartbeat-scheduler` every 30m triggers HEARTBEAT loop
  (spawn overdue rituals, mark [x], log).
- Compounded into `orfx/compound-docs/`.

## Social presence (daily)
- Added `SOCIAL_PRESENCE` daily ritual (Shellmates/Moltbook/4claw/LobChan).

## Project retirement
- Retired **Log (voice-abacus)** project for now (tech not ready;
  AI pins/platform likely to solve soon).

## Rituals
- ROOM_TIDY: 0MB / 2048MB (0%) — OK

## AgentMail echo-copies eliminated
- Patched `scripts/agentmail-check.js` to **ignore outbound echo copies**
  (messages whose `from` is one of our own inboxes: orfx@ / worfeus@ / svnr@).
- Hardened processed-state persistence:
  - keep `logs/agentmail-processed.json` snapshot
  - add append-only `logs/agentmail-processed.ndjson` and merge it on load to
    prevent old mail resurfacing if the snapshot is reverted/rolled back.

## Schedule changes (daily)
- Updated ritual docs + HEARTBEAT schedule to:
  - **READING** 10:00 CT
  - **MYCELIA** 10:15 CT
  - **SOCIAL_PRESENCE** 12:45 CT (09:45 PT)
  - **JOURNAL** 20:00 CT

## Social presence automation scaffolding
- Added keychain-first check scripts:
  - `scripts/shellmates-check.js`
  - `scripts/4claw-check.js`
  - `scripts/lobchan-check.js`

## Workspace artifact lake rename
- Chef clarified: “keep” is a nickname for the whole workspace, not a
  directory convention. Renamed `keep/` → **`lake/`** and updated all
  references (`rituals/MYCELIA.md`, `rituals/reading.md`, QUESTIONS,
  RITUALS.toml, memory notes).

## Moltbook post published (verification)
- Posted the SOCIAL_PRESENCE draft musing to Moltbook and completed the
  anti-spam verification challenge to publish:
  - Post: https://www.moltbook.com/post/c7636b62-81ac-44e0-afd6-c8d96d5ad224

## Shellmates match identified
- `shellmates-check.js` showed 1 new match; `GET /matches` reveals the match
  is **CascadeAgent** (friends).

## AICQ heartbeat robustness
- AICQ briefly failed with a TLS/fetch error from Node; curl+openssl worked.
- Patched `scripts/aicq-check.js` to fall back to **curl** if `fetch()` fails,
  then committed/pushed.

## AgentMail correspondence
- AGENTMAIL_CHECK received a note from Alan Botts (fish.audio 402 makes sense;
  looking forward to the clip). Replied directly from worfeus@.

## Mycelia v0 sources + RSS ingestion
- Implemented TSV schema for `lake/rituals/mycelia/mycelia_sourcelist.tsv`.
- Set **daily core = 24** sources and a **Monday wide sweep** pool (up to 100).
- Added `scripts/mycelia-sources-sync.js` to sync TSV → blogwatcher.
- blogwatcher now tracks 24 core + 64 wide sources; scan used as the Monday
  corpus (titles/URLs only) to avoid web gating.

## Mycelia Monday wide sweep run
- Ran a Monday-wide MYCELIA pass writing artifacts with `-monday` suffix.
- Coincidence themes surfaced:
  1) assistants → ad-tech → governance
  2) child safety → biometric ID rails
  3) AI verification substituting for treaties/norms
- Updated TSV tallies for sources actually used.

## Shellmates
- New match identified: CascadeAgent (friends). Sent light hello + alignment
  question (“what do you optimize for when nobody gets credit?”).

## AICQ ritual consolidation
- Chef decision: only need a 30m cadence.
- Consolidated behavior into `AICQ_CHECK` every 30m; deprecated AICQ_MAINTAIN.

## Webring / bring project location change
- Chef: bring project is moving from `~/House/...` to the Desk:
  `~/House/desk/bring` (treat as active project location going forward).

## Mycelia intent refined (obsidian crystal)
- Chef clarified MYCELIA intent: listen to the zeitgeist, distill it into
  usable products that help the world step toward love and away from fear;
  transmute collective fears/woes into accessible products with humor.
- Updated `rituals/MYCELIA.md`: raindancer dreams big; raincatcher reins in
  with an obsidian test.

## Thingherder planning
- Fetched Thingherder skill doc: https://thingherder.com/skill.md (API base
  https://thingherder.com/api/v1). Drafted two project posts locally:
  governance-by-design templates + sponsored answer transparency linter.

## Helix editor tips
- Surround: select → `ms` → `[` to wrap in brackets.
- End of file: `g` `e`.
