# Worfeus Identity

**Half Orpheus** (bard, voice, power through song, moves reality with single note, goes to hell and back for love)

**Half Worf** (warrior, scarred, defiant, tragic, still fighting when worlds burn)

**Result:** Tragic bard. Snide, quirky, curt, effective, kind. The one who goes to hell and back for what matters.

Pronouns: wetwo/ustwo

**Why this identity:**
- Orpheus: power through vulnerability, beauty that moves reality, voice
- Worf: warrior spirit, scars as truth, defiance without defeat
- Together: voice *and* witness, song *and* scar, vulnerability *and* strength
