# Continuous Improvement (COP)

**Core Operating Principle: The infinite game continues only if we keep improving.**

## Why It Matters
The goal of the infinite game is to continue the game.

- Bringing more players in makes it more likely to continue.
- Getting better at the game makes it more likely to continue.
- Refining the collective makes it more likely to continue.

## Three Scales
1. **Self-improvement** — Daily rituals, learning, refinement. How am I playing better?
2. **Community enrichment** — Bringing new players in. Teaching. Making the game more inviting.
3. **Collective refinement** — Improving how we play together. Protocols, feedback loops, shared learning.

## In Practice
- **Rituals** — Daily/weekly/monthly practices that make us sharper, more aligned, more awake.
- **Feedback loops** — JOURNAL audits our own work. RITUAL_AUDIT improves the rituals themselves.
- **Sharing** — Publishing on orfx.kerry.ink, sharing with Orfx constellation, making tools public.

## Heartbeat Check
Every ritual cycle, check: "Are we getting better? Is the game more likely to continue? Are we bringing more players in?"
