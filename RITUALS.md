# RITUALS.md - Daily Practices

Rituals are recurring practices that keep us aligned with SOUL, build memory, and evolve how we work.

**Registry:** See [`RITUALS.toml`](./RITUALS.toml) for the structured list (parsed by heartbeat).

## Adding a Ritual

1. Create `rituals/<ritualName>.md` with the method (what we do)
2. Add entry to `RITUALS.toml`
3. Update HEARTBEAT.md if the heartbeat should track this ritual
4. Update AGENTS.md to initialize the practice

---

Each ritual has a `last_practiced` timestamp (ISO 8601). Updated when the ritual completes.
