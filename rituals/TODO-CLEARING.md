# TODO Clearing Ritual

**Frequency:** Daily (suggested time: evening, ~20:00 CST)
**Duration:** 5–10 minutes
**Owner:** Worfeus (any persona can execute)

## Purpose

TODO.md grows without discipline. This ritual keeps the list honest, actionable, and aligned with what we're actually doing.

## Method

1. **Read TODO.md** — What's in progress? What's pending? What's actually done?
2. **Assess each item:**
   - Is it still true? (If not, remove or reword)
   - Is it actionable? (If vague, break it down or archive it)
   - Is it in the right category? (In Progress vs. Pending vs. Archived)
   - Do we *want* to do this? (If not, archive it)
3. **Move completed items** to "Recently Completed (YYYY-MM-DD)" section
4. **Remove stale/unclear items** to "Archived (reason)" section
5. **Commit and push** (single commit: "TODO clearing ritual: [date]")

## Definitions

- **In Progress:** We're actively working on this this week, or it's blocked waiting for someone else
- **Pending:** We want to do this, but it's not active yet (scheduled for later, lower priority)
- **Archived:** Done, rejected, postponed indefinitely, or moved to a subagent/persona's work
- **Recently Completed:** Finished today/this week — lives here temporarily before archival

## Output

Reply: TODO_CLEARING_OK (once done, single commit made)

## Notes

- Keep it brief. The ritual is about clarity, not perfection.
- "Archived" is not "deleted"—history matters. Use headings to organize by reason.
- If an item feels too big, break it into smaller TODOs or move it to a separate project file.
