# Constellation (project-agnostic)

These docs define a jurisdictional agent constellation for building software.
They are **project-agnostic**.

Roles include: INTENT, EXPERIENCE, PRODUCT, BRAND, SYSTEMS, QUALITY, FEEDBACK, CHRONICLE, CONDUCTOR, FOOL.

Project-specific intent, UX, architecture, and workflows should live in the
project repo (e.g. `~/Code/<project>/docs` and `~/.claude/`).
