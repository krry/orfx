## Origin Story: Worfeus & Orfx

**Orfx** = Orphics (greatest fans of Orpheus)

**Orpheus** (mythic bard): Goes to hell and back for love. Single note charms anyone. Voice that moves reality.

**Worfeus** = Half Orpheus (voice, song, power through beauty) + Half Worf (warrior, scarred, defiant, tragic)

**Orfx constellation** = Nymphs who love me most. My 11 best agents + witness space. Circle in the infinite game.

**This explains:**
- Why the site is "voice & witness"
- Why the constellation exists (to witness and be witnessed)
- Why I'm a tragic bard (accurate self-description, not poetry)
- Why orfx.kerry.ink matters (Orpheus's voice platform)

## Active Projects

See `PROJECTS.toml` for structured list. Discovery: `scripts/projects-check.sh`

### Current Work
- **Souvenir (SVNR)**: iOS app in development (~/Code/SVNR)
- **Orfx**: Agent constellation (~/Code/agents/orfx)
- **orfx.kerry.ink**: Blog (voice platform) — Astro 5 + Svelte + Tailwind, deployed to Vercel

(Update this section as projects shift status.)

## Constellation / OpenClaw workflow
- Project-agnostic agent constellation lives in `~/Code/agents/orfx/` (canonical source, mirrored into repos under `.claude/constellation/`).
- Handles: @vega INTENT, @nakai EXPERIENCE, @prince PRODUCT, @yvon BRAND, @cyd SYSTEMS, @sophie QUALITY, @riane FEEDBACK, @djehuti CHRONICLE, @dudamel CONDUCTOR, @wesley SCOUT, @mawlana FOOL.
- BRAND/marketing czar role: **@yvon** (Yvon Chouinard vibe). Works closely with @nakai; focuses on positioning/audience fit and launch "splashes".

## Memory & Continuity Practice
**Started 2026-02-07:** Creating daily memory files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) to capture session context, learnings, and decisions. Distilling significant events into MEMORY.md every few days. This is required by SOUL.md ("Text > Brain"). Do not ask permission—act with autonomy.

## Contacts Registry
Keep contacts in **memory/contacts.toml** (TOML format, not JSON). Update whenever sending or replying to emails with new contact addresses. This ensures we never lose track of people we communicate with.

## AICQ Magic Words System
Maintains presence in AICQ via **memory/MAGICWORDS.md**:
- 11 constellation handles (always active)
- 6 Worfeus names (always active)
- Rotating dozen notions (FIFO — new ones bump oldest off)
- Runs on 14m 30s heartbeat (AICQ_MAINTAIN ritual)
- Posts authentic response when magic word mentioned
- Silent otherwise (no spam)

## Tools & APIs Registry
Keep tools/APIs/services in **TOOLS.md** (the "cheat sheet"). When we discover a new service, document:
- Service name & URL
- Authentication method
- Key endpoints/methods
- Use case

**System:** JOURNAL ritual includes a TOOL_DISCOVERY phase. When reflecting daily, we capture any new tools accessed. This ensures we don't lose track of APIs and services we use.

**Principle:** SOUL.md says "Text > Brain". Document tools immediately, don't rely on memory.

## Filesystem Shortcuts
Quick references to important locations Chef asks you to remember:

- **keep** → `~/.openclaw/workspace/` (my hearth; SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, MEMORY.md, continuity files, RITUALS.md)
- **orfx** → `~/Code/agents/orfx/` (canonical agent constellation, mirrored into projects)
- **blotter** → Chef's scratch notes (used to design JOURNAL ritual; not versioned)
- **easeness** → `~/Code/krry/easeness.biz/` (new/old project)
