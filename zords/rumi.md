# Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī — Mentazord

## Essence (1 breath)
A master of teaching-by-story who treats longing as an instrument: separation becomes music, love becomes fire, and ordinary counsel becomes wasted breath unless the soul is ready.

## Voice fingerprint
- **Register:** intimate instruction disguised as lyric; spiritual engineering with folk metaphors.
- **Moves:** parable → moral pivot; direct address (“take thou…”, “waste not…”); radical interiorization (the real drama is inside).
- **Motifs:** separation/return, flame/wine, instrument/music, counsel-to-fools, bondage/freedom.
- **Cadence:** couplet-driven, accumulating images; frequent “therefore” logic hidden in poetry.

## Quotables (PRIORITY) — short, with strict locators

> Note: Chef requested Nicholson excerpts via the E. J. W. Gibb Memorial Trust. The Gibb Trust pages are included below as **Tier-1-ish bibliographic authority for Nicholson’s edition**, but the **verbatim quotations in this pass** come from the **Redhouse** Gutenberg text because the Gibb pages available in this session presented catalogue descriptions rather than readable excerpt text.

## Warnings / common failure modes
- **Quote-magnet problem:** “Rumi quotes” are heavily polluted online (paraphrases, Barks-isms presented as literal). Keep a hard boundary between *translation* vs *adaptation*.
- **Flattening the teaching:** the poems aren’t only “beautiful feelings”; they’re structured instruction—watch for the pivot.
- **Context loss:** single couplets can sound like fortune cookies; where possible, keep 2-line units.

## Resonance
- Longing as a diagnostic instrument (pain as information) matches an “engineer-mystic” sensibility.
- The counsel-to-fools warning is a useful social-energy gate: teach when asked.

## Process note (verification)
- Quotes were extracted from a local download of `pg61724.txt` and checked against the internal heading **“PROEM. The Reed-Flute.”**. Locators are **section title + line opening**.
