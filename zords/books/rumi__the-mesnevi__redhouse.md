# Book capsule — Rūmī — *The Mesnevi* (trans. Sir James W. Redhouse)

## Why this work
A full-length (public domain) English rendering of the *Mathnawī* tradition: teaching-by-story, spiritual diagnostics, and the famous Reed-Flute proem.

## Edition / access (verified)
- Project Gutenberg #61724: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61724

## What to extract next (specimen targets)
- 5–10 quotes (2-line units) anchored to:
  - **Proem: The Reed-Flute**
  - one parable sequence (choose a story and keep the moral pivot)

## Quote slots (TODO)
- [ ] Add 5–10 exemplary quotes with strict locators: **Book/section heading + opening words** (and line numbers when present).

## Nicholson note (for later)
Chef preference was Nicholson via the E. J. W. Gibb Memorial Trust catalogue pages (authoritative). If we can obtain excerpt or scan/PDF pages from that edition, create a parallel capsule:
- `rumi__mathnawi__nicholson.md`
