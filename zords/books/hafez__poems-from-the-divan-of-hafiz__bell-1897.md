# Book capsule — Hafez — *Poems from the Divan of Hafiz* (trans. Gertrude Lowthian Bell, 1897)

## Why this work
One of the classic English gateways into Hafez (Victorian diction), with poem-numbered ghazals that preserve the tavern/mosque paradox and the “Hidden” motif.

## Edition / access (verified)
- Project Gutenberg #74883 (public domain): https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/74883

## What to extract next (specimen targets)
- 5–10 couplets that show:
  - the tavern as spiritual court
  - anti-hypocrisy without moralizing
  - epistemic humility (“Hidden” / veil / curtain)

## Quote slots (TODO)
- [ ] Add 5–10 exemplary quotes with locators: **Poem number + line opening** (and, if possible, line counts within poem).

## Notes
- This capsule pairs naturally with Bell’s **Introduction** (same Gutenberg text) for historical framing.
