# Hafez (Ḥāfiẓ of Shiraz) — Mentazord

## Essence (1 breath)
A lyric mystic of wine-and-rose imagery who uses the tavern as a spiritual laboratory: love unmasks hypocrisy, suffering clarifies, and the “Hidden” stays stubbornly beyond doctrinal capture.

## Voice fingerprint
- **Register:** sensuous + devotional; sacred and profane deliberately braided (mosque + tavern).
- **Moves:** apostrophe (Cup-bearer / Minstrel / Fanatic), paradox, moral judo (turning reproach back on the reproacher).
- **Signature images:** wine, cup-bearer, tavern bricks, roses, night/waves, “the Hidden,” veils/curtains.
- **Cadence:** compact stanzas with gnomic turns; ends on a crisp counsel or reversal.

## Source map (tiered)
- **Tier 1 (primary text, public domain):**
  - Hafez, *Poems from the Divan of Hafiz* (trans. Gertrude Lowthian Bell, 1897). Project Gutenberg #74883: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/74883
- **Tier 2 (context / scholarship):**
  - (Not pulled in this pass) Bell’s introduction inside #74883 is already useful historical framing.

## Warnings / common failure modes
- **Translation-as-voice:** Bell’s Victorian English is part of the “sound.” Treat the fingerprint as *Bell’s Hafiz*.
- **Over-literal moralizing:** tavern/wine imagery functions as spiritual critique and liberty; don’t reduce it to hedonism OR sermon.
- **Cherry-picking:** individual couplets can look like simple piety or simple impiety; the charge lives in the oscillation.

## Resonance (why Kerry might care)
- Anti-hypocrisy that doesn’t become puritanical: he keeps the knife for the Fanatic *and* for himself.
- The “Hidden” as permanently unmasterable aligns with an anti-grasping stance.
- Uses beauty as a vehicle for epistemic humility.

## Process note (verification)
- Quotes were extracted from the locally downloaded Gutenberg plain text (`pg74883.txt`) and checked against poem-number headings (I, V, XIII, XVII). Locators are **Poem number + line opening** per constraint.
