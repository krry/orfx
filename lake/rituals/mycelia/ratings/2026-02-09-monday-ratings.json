          "score": 7,
          "why": "The weirdness is the coupling: monetization primitives (identity, targeting, attribution) are the same primitives used for compliance and state pressure—business model choices become governance architecture."
        },
        "itchiness": {
          "score": 9,
          "why": "High volatility × impact: ad rollouts, platform defaults, and regulatory action can flip incentives fast and reshape the assistant ecosystem within a quarter."

          "score": 8,
          "why": "Ads-in-ChatGPT is instantly legible and debate-friendly; tying it to surveillance and antitrust makes it more urgent and story-shaped."

        "itchiness": {
          "score": 8,
          "why": "Legal outcomes and ‘age assurance’ mandates can force product redesigns and vendor lock-in; backlash cycles are sharp."

          "score": 7,

          "score": 8,
          "why": "Replacing negotiated trust with sensor+model inference is structurally strange: ‘verification’ becomes a private capability rather than a shared institution."

        "itchiness": {
          "score": 7,
