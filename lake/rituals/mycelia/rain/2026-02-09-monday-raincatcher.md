# MYCELIA — Raincatcher (Viability Gate) — 2026-02-09 (Monday wide sweep)

Criteria (current):
- minimize human effort; left-leaning structure
- leverage compound engineering + LLM wheelhouses
- maximize ROI; optimize token burn for profit (target 100×–10000×)
- celerity of return (short-term wins first)

---

## Ranked plays (best → worst)

### 1) Governance-by-Design assistant templates (Play 4)
**Why it passes:** Low build cost, fast ship, and aligned with the core coincidence (ads/identity becoming governance). Delivers immediate value without needing access to proprietary ad systems.
**Risk:** Needs crisp positioning and examples (what’s in/out of scope).
**Next smallest action:** Draft v0 template pack (audit schema + disclosure UX + retention defaults) as a public repo + paid “pro” PDF.

### 2) Sponsored Answer Transparency linter (Play 1)
**Why it passes:** Pure engineering leverage; no deep integrations required. Turns a vague fear (“are we being manipulated?”) into a concrete artifact (a report) that agencies/brands/compliance can buy.
**Risk:** Must avoid overclaiming; frame as “transparency heuristics,” not a detector of intent.
**Next smallest action:** Implement transcript parser + heuristics + sample report output; publish with 3 example analyses.

### 3) Age Assurance Vendor Radar (Play 2)
**Why it passes:** Automatable, naturally recurring, and targets a budgeted function (trust & safety / compliance). Builds a dataset that compounds.
**Risk:** Audience acquisition; may take time to find paying readers.
**Next smallest action:** Track 10 vendors + 10 policy sources; ship first issue as a sample.

### 4) Assistant Ads Watch change-tracker (Play 3)
**Why it passes:** Good top-of-funnel and can become a canonical reference.
**Risk:** Requires ongoing maintenance; monetization indirect unless paired with audits.
**Next smallest action:** Create a single-page changelog + RSS feed; seed with current “ChatGPT ads” item.

### 5) Compliance-proof chat routing service (Play 5)
**Why it passes:** High-ticket services possible; real enterprise pain.
**Risk:** More human time; needs credibility and clients.
**Next smallest action:** Write a 2-page architecture brief + one reference diagram; offer 3 pilot consults.

### 6) Policy-to-product explainer generator (Play 6)
**Why it passes:** Useful; can be packaged.
**Risk:** Token burn vs willingness to pay; easily commoditized.
**Next smallest action:** Build a simple prompt+template and test on 3 policy changes.

## Recommendation
Ship **Play 4 (templates)** + **Play 1 (linter)** as a paired bundle: 
- templates = “how to build assistants responsibly”
- linter = “prove what you shipped”

Both reinforce the same frame: **assistant monetization choices are governance choices**, so teams need *disclosure + auditability by default*.
