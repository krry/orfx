# MYCELIA — Raindancer (Monetization Ideas) — 2026-02-09 (Monday wide sweep)

Source coincidence focus: **Assistants become ad-tech; ad-tech becomes governance** (plus biometric ID rails).

Money plays optimized for: minimal human effort, automation-first, fast time-to-first-dollar.

---

## Play 1 — “Sponsored Answer Transparency” linter (open-source → paid audit)
**What:** A small CLI + report generator that checks exported assistant transcripts (or app logs) for *ad disclosure patterns* and produces a “sponsored output transparency report” (labeling presence, link attribution, confidence language, call-to-action density).
- **Automation path:** Node/TS CLI + markdown/JSON report; optional GitHub Action
- **Time-to-first-dollar:** 10–21 days (sell audits to agencies/brands building assistant experiences)
- **Capital/credits:** low (no model calls required; optional summarizer)
- **Distribution:** GitHub + blog post + outreach to AI UX agencies

## Play 2 — “Age Assurance Vendor Radar” (weekly brief + dataset)
**What:** A weekly tracked digest of age assurance / ID verification vendors, policy moves, and platform rollouts (Discord-style). Include a simple CSV dataset (vendors, methods, jurisdictions, friction).
- **Automation path:** RSS monitors → summarize → markdown; minimal human curation
- **Time-to-first-dollar:** 14–45 days (paid newsletter for trust/safety teams)
- **Capital/credits:** low
- **Distribution:** LinkedIn + trust/safety communities + compliance newsletters

## Play 3 — “Assistant Ads Watch” change-tracker (free dashboard → sponsor)
**What:** A lightweight change log tracking where/when assistants introduce ads (tiers, regions, UI placements), with screenshots where available and a “what changed” diff.
- **Automation path:** monitoring + manual spot checks (start), automate later
- **Time-to-first-dollar:** 21–60 days (sponsor or consulting lead gen)
- **Capital/credits:** low
- **Distribution:** public webpage + RSS feed + social posts

## Play 4 — “Governance-by-Design” templates for assistant builders
**What:** A template pack for teams embedding LLM assistants: disclosure UX, audit logging schema, consent + retention defaults, and “no dark patterns” guardrails.
- **Automation path:** docs + code snippets; sell as kit + updates
- **Time-to-first-dollar:** 7–14 days
- **Capital/credits:** near-zero
- **Distribution:** Gumroad + targeted dev communities

## Play 5 — “Compliance-proof chat routing” service (consulting wedge)
**What:** A consult-to-product offering: design a routing layer that separates (a) user identity, (b) conversation content, (c) ad targeting signals, so teams can claim least-privilege data flows.
- **Automation path:** architecture docs + reference implementation; later SaaS
- **Time-to-first-dollar:** 14–30 days (services)
- **Capital/credits:** low
- **Distribution:** direct outreach to AI product leads

## Play 6 — “Biometric creep” policy-to-product explainer generator
**What:** A generator that turns a policy change (trial ruling, platform age rule) into a product checklist: what to log, what to disclose, what to avoid.
- **Automation path:** LLM summarizer + templated checklist outputs
- **Time-to-first-dollar:** 21–45 days (sell to small app studios as subscription)
- **Capital/credits:** low-medium (token burn)
- **Distribution:** app dev newsletters + marketplaces
