# MYCELIA — Raincatcher (Viability Gate) — 2026-02-09

Criteria (current):
- minimize human effort; left-leaning structure
- leverage compound engineering + LLM wheelhouses
- maximize ROI; optimize token burn for profit (target 100×–10000×)
- celerity of return (short-term wins first)

---

## Ranked plays (best → worst)

### 1) Xcode Agent Safety Checklist + Lint Rules (Play 4)
**Why it passes:** Very low build cost, clear audience (iOS teams), fast ship, and naturally “left-leaning” (safety controls). Can be sold as a kit and later expanded.
**Risk:** Needs crisp positioning + credible examples.
**Next smallest action:** Draft a 1-page checklist + publish a template repo (no code-gen yet).

### 2) Agent Audit Trail GitHub Action (Play 1)
**Why it passes:** Directly addresses emerging “agent governance” gap; can be a tiny CLI + Action. High ROI if it becomes default plumbing.
**Risk:** Must avoid collecting sensitive prompts; prefer hashing + local artifacts.
**Next smallest action:** Build MVP that emits `agent-audit.json` + PR comment summary.

### 3) Governed-Agent Templates for Snowflake Cortex (Play 3)
**Why it passes:** Consulting-to-product path; immediate dollars possible with minimal engineering, and aligns with enterprise governance trend.
**Risk:** Requires access to Snowflake-specific buyer channels.
**Next smallest action:** Create 3 template workflows and a sales page/one-pager.

### 4) Robotics Policy Radar (Play 5)
**Why it passes:** Automatable and low effort once set up; good for positioning.
**Risk:** Longer time-to-revenue unless you already have an audience.
**Next smallest action:** Set up 10 tracked sources + generate first issue as a sample.

### 5) Model Supply-Chain Scanner (Play 2)
**Why it passes:** Real need; security budget.
**Risk:** Harder to do credibly without deep research; liability if claims are overstated.
**Next smallest action:** Build a “non-diagnostic” reporting tool (signals only) and market as a triage layer.

### 6) Stablecoin Rewards Simulator (Play 7)
**Why it passes:** Useful; can be built simply.
**Risk:** Dependent on policy outcomes; buyer urgency varies.
**Next smallest action:** Draft scenario matrix + simple spreadsheet prototype.

### 7) On-Device Voice Concierge (Play 6)
**Why it passes:** Big market; strong narrative.
**Risk:** Slow build and sales cycle; higher support burden.
**Next smallest action:** Build a single vertical demo (one scripted flow) before expanding.

## Recommendation
Do **Play 4** + **Play 1** in parallel as “governance plumbing for agents” (one IDE-focused, one repo/CI-focused). They reinforce each other and can share the same conceptual frame: *agentic tools require provable boundaries + traceability*.
